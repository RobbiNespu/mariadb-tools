mariadb-repmgr(1) -- MariaDB replication manager
===========================================

## NAME

mariadb-repmgr -- MariaDB replication manager utility

## SYNOPSIS

`mariadb-repmgr [OPTIONS]`

## DESCRIPTION

**mariadb-repmgr** allows users to monitor interactively MariaDB 10.x GTID replication health and trigger slave to master promotion (aka switchover), or elect a new master in case of failure (aka switchover).

At a minimum, required options are: a list of hosts (mariadb-repmgr can autodetect topologies), user with privileges (ALL), and replication user (with REPLICATION SLAVE privileges)

To perform switchover, mariadb-repmgr uses a mechanism similar to common mysql failover tools such as MHA:

  * Verify replication settings
  * Check (configurable) replication on the slaves
  * Check for long running queries on master
  * Elect a new master (usually the most up to date, but it could also be a designated candidate)
  * Put down the IP address on master by calling an optional script
  * Reject writes on master by calling FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK
  * Kill long running threads on master if any remaining
  * Watching for all slaves to catch up to the current GTID position
  * Promote the candidate slave to be a new master
  * Put up the IP address on new master by calling an optional script
  * Switch other slaves and old master to be slaves of the new master and set them as read-only

## EXAMPLES

Start mariadb-repmgr in interactive mode with master host db1 and slaves db2 and db3:

`mariadb-repmgr -hosts=db1,db2,db3 -user=root -repl=replicator`

Start mariadb-repmgr in interactive mode using full host and port syntax, using root login for management and repl login for replication switchover, with failover scripts and added verbosity. Accept a maximum slave delay of 15 seconds before performing switchover:

`mariadb-repmgr -hosts=db1:3306,db2:3306,db2:3306 -user=root:pass -rpluser=repl:pass -pre-failover-script="/usr/local/bin/vipdown.sh" -post-failover-script="/usr/local/bin/vipup.sh" -verbose -maxdelay 15`

Automatically failover a dead master in the above setup:

`mariadb-repmgr -hosts=db1:3306,db2:3306,db2:3306 -user=root:pass -rpluser=repl:pass -pre-failover-script="/usr/local/bin/vipdown.sh" -post-failover-script="/usr/local/bin/vipup.sh" -failover=dead`

## OPTIONS

  * -failover `<state>`

    Perform non-interactive failover. `state` can be either `dead` or `alive`, reflecting the current master's state. The action will result in removing the master of the current replication topology.

  * -gtidcheck `<boolean>`

    Check that GTID sequence numbers are identical before initiating failover. Default false. This must be used if you want your servers to be perfectly in sync before initiating master switchover. If false, mariadb-repmgr will wait for the slaves to be in sync before initiating.
  
  * -hosts `<address>:[port],`

    List of MariaDB hosts IP and port (optional), specified in the `host:[port]` format and comma-separated.

  * -interactive `<boolean>`

    Runs the MariaDB monitor in interactive mode (default). A value of false allows mariadb-repmgr to invoke switchover without displaying the interactive monitor.

  * -maxdelay `<seconds>`

    Maximum slave replication delay allowed for initiating switchover, in seconds.

  * -post-failover-script `<path>`

    Path of post-failover script, to be invoked after new master promotion.
  
  * -pre-failover-script `<path>`
  
    Path of pre-failover script to be invoked before master election.

  * -prefmaster `<address>`

    Preferred candidate server for master failover, in `host:[port]` format.
  
  * -readonly `<boolean>`

    Set slaves as read-only when performing switchover. Default true.

  * -rpluser `<user>:[password]`

    Replication user and password. This user must have REPLICATION SLAVE privileges and is used to setup the old master as a new slave.

  * -socket `<path>`

    Path of MariaDB unix socket. Default is "/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock"

  * -user `<user>:[password]`

    User for MariaDB login, specified in the `user:[password]` format. Must have administrative privileges. This user is used to perform switchover.

  * -verbose

    Print detailed execution information.

  * -version

    Return softawre version.

  * -wait-kill `<msecs>`

    Wait this many milliseconds before killing threads on demoted master. Default 5000 ms.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

`mariadb-repmgr` is a self-contained binary, which means that no dependencies are needed at the operating system level.
On the MariaDB side, slaves need to use GTID for replication. Old-style positional replication is not supported.
